	abstract = {General expressions for the dependence of the polarization of the radiation emitted in an atomic electronic transition upon the angle of emission are derived on the basis of a vector-spherical-harmonic/Bessel-function description of the photon. The concept of a photon of a specific multipolarity, i.e. quadrupole, octupole, etc, and identifiable as such, is found to be unviable. The angular distribution and dependence upon distance from the source of the transverse and parallel components of the electric and magnetic fields arising from E1, E2, M1 and M2 atomic electronic emissions are elucidated.}
