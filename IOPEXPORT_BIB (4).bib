	abstract = {The objective of nuclear fusion research is to find out whether or not the nuclear energy of the light elements, especially that released when hydrogen isotopes react to form helium, can be put to practical use to provide a virtually limitless source of energy. This research has been conducted on an increasing scale since 1946 when a patent was taken out by Thomson and Blackmann (1946) to produce high temperatures and D-D thermonuclear fusion reactions in a toroidal electric discharge of about 500 kA. Nowadays the research is carried out on a scale of several hundred million dollars a year in each of Western Europe, the U.S.A, Japan and the Soviet Union.}
