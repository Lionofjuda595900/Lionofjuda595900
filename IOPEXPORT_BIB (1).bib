	abstract = {An alternative and somewhat systematic definition of the vector spherical harmonics, in analogy with the commonly used scalar spherical harmonics, is presented. The new set of vector spherical harmonics satisfies the properties of orthogonality and completeness, and is compared with other existing definitions of vector spherical harmonics. Some applications to problems in magnetostatics are illustrated.}
